Description: Run the LWF-BROOK90 hydrological model from within R. The central
    function writes input files from model control options, parameters, soil and
    climate data, starts the commandline tool of the LWF-BROOK90 hydrological model
    and returns its output files. Additionally, submodels for defining vegetation
    dynamics and pedotransfer functions for deriving soil hydraulic parameters are
    provided.
