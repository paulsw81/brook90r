brook90r
========

This R extension contains code to run the LWF-Brook90 forest hydrology model. The model is a small executable windows computer program that can be obtained from the Bayrische Landesanstalt f√ºr Wald und Forstwirtschaft (LWF) at Freising, Germany. Ask Dr. Stephan Raspe. Basicly, 'brook90r' provides functions for writing input files, starting the executable file using system calls, and reading the output files that are generated by the model.
