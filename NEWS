brook90r v1.1.1 (Release date: 2019-02-12)
==============

Changes:

  * Changed arguments of approx_standprop-function for interpolating stand properties.
     The function now also takes dates (doy) of budburst and leaffall as defined in param.b90,
     if options.b90$standprop.use_growthperiod = T. In this case, the yearly linear changes
     in stand properties (growth) are accomplished during the growing season.
     This also affects the age-variable in the Climate.in-file, which is used to calculate
     vertical and lateral root growth: Age remains constant during winter, and increases
     linearly by one year between budburst and leaffall, so that root growth takes place
     during the growing season only.
