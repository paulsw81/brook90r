#' brook90r: A package for running the LWF-BROOK90 hydrological model from within R
#'
#' The central function Run.B90() writes model input files from model control options and parameters,
#' climate and soil data, executes the external model code and returns the model results.
#' The model control options thereby let the user select different methods for defining
#' phenology and leaf area index seasonality, root density depth distributions,
#' and inter-annual variation of stand height and stem area index variation.
#' Additionally, a set of pedotransfer functions is provided to derive hydraulic
#' parameters from soil physical properties. For an introduction to the basic usage see \code{vignette('intro_brook90r')}.
