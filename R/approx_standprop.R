#' Create a daily sequence of stand properties from parameters using interpolation
#'
#' Uses yearly values of inter-annual vegetation development values (e.g. sai, height, densef, age)
#' and interpolates them to a daily sequence.
#'
#' @param x.years A sequence of years or a single year
#' @param y vector of the same length as x.years. If aprox.method = 'linear',
#' the values are interpreted to be valid at the end of the respective year in x.years.
#' @param y.ini initial value used as a starting point for linear interpolation.
#' Interpreted to be valid at the 1st of January of the first year in x.years.
#' Ignored if approx.method = 'constant'.
#' @param xout.years years for which ouput is generated, maybe longer or shorter than
#' x.years. For years outside x.years, the value of the closest data extrem is returned.
#' @param use_growthperiod logical: Use startdoy and enddoy for linear interpolation?
#' If TRUE, yearly changes take place between startdoy and enddoy, other wise from end of year to end of year.
#' @param startdoy a single value or vector of the same length as x.years, with the day of year when growth begins.
#' @param enddoy a single value or vector of the same length as x.years, with the day of year when growth cessates.
#' @param approx.method name of interpolation method ('constant' or 'linear').
#' @param return_xout logical. If true, daily values of y AND a date vector are returned in a data.table.
#'
#' @return A vector of interpolated daily values
#'
#' @details For \code{approx.method = 'constant'}, the value of y is returned for the whole respective year in x.years,
#' which results in a yearly changing step function. If \code{approx.method = 'linear'},
#' the values of y are interpolated between the years in x.years, and interpreted to be reached
#' at the 31st of December of the respective x.years. In this case, y.ini is required as the initial value,
#' from which the sequence is interpolated to the first value of y. The linear changes are either accomplished
#' between 31st to 31st of December of the years in x.years, or during the growing season only (use_growingseason = TRUE).
