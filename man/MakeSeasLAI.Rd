for one year}

}
\arguments{
\item{method}{name of method for generating the sequence. Must be one of "b90", "linear", "Coupmodel"}

\item{maxlai}{maximum value during summer (not used when method = 'linear')}

\item{winlaifrac}{minimum lai as fraction of maxlai during winter (not used when method = 'linear')}

\item{budburst.doy}{day of year when growth begins (not used when method = 'linear')}

\item{leaffall.doy}{day of year when growth cessates (not used when method = 'linear')}

\item{emerge.dur}{number of days until maximum value is reached (required when method = "Coupmodel")}

\item{leaffall.dur}{number of days until minimum value is reached (required when method = "b90")}

\item{shape.budburst}{shape parameter for the growth phase (required when method = "Coupmodel")}

\item{shape.leaffall}{shape parameter growth cessation (required when method = "Coupmodel")}

\item{lai.doy}{vector of integers (required when method = "linear")}

\item{lai.frac}{vector of values corresponding to doy.values (required when method = "linear")}

\item{maxdoy}{last day of year (leapyear: 366, else 365)}

\item{opt.doy}{day of year when optimum value is reached (required when method = "Coupmodel")}
}
\value{
Returns a seasonal sequence of length maxdoy
}
\description{
Creates the seasonal course of leaf area index, based
on minimum lai, maximum lai, budburst and leaffall day of year (doy) and shape
parameters.
