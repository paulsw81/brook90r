\title{brook90r: A package for running the LWF-BROOK90 hydrological model from within R}
\description{
The central function Run.B90() writes model input files from model control options and parameters,
climate and soil data, executes the external model code and returns the model results.
The model control options thereby let the user select different methods for defining
phenology and leaf area index seasonality, root density depth distributions,
and inter-annual variation of stand height and stem area index variation.
Additionally, a set of pedotransfer functions is provided to derive hydraulic
parameters from soil physical properties. For an introduction to the basic usage see \code{vignette('intro_brook90r')}.
