	abstract = {Abstract Simulations of soil water and evapotranspiration with physically based models at broad scales vary in both complexity of processes modeled and in parameterization of soil and root properties. Sensitivity of annual evaporation Eann to some of these processes and parameters was tested with both a model allowing multiple soil layers (BROOK90) and a single-layered water balance model (WBM). For nine widely scattered locations in North America Eann was controlled primarily by climate and cover type, but within a location–type combination, Eann was controlled primarily by the available water capacity Wac, which is the product of available water fraction and effective root depth. The definition of the upper limit of available water is important; it is precisely defined here as the water volume fraction at 30-cm depth after 48 h of drainage from an initially saturated, homogeneous profile with a fixed gravity potential gradient at 2-m depth. Specification of root depth was as important as specification of available water fraction in determining Wac. In climates of intermediate wetness a 100-mm change in Wac caused a similar change in Eann at low Wac, but little change in Eann at high Wac. WBM responded similarly to BROOK90. In BROOK90, texture-dependent hydraulic properties caused additional effects of less than ±50 mm in Eann for short covers and even less for tall covers. Effective root depth interacted with both distribution of infiltration and upward movement of water in the soil profile, but the effects were also on the order of only 50 mm. A multilayered model does not seem necessary for simulating Eann at the global scale if the primary objective is budget closure. Improvement in estimating Eann with WBM or similar global water budget models is not likely to result from making the model more complicated with respect to soil and root properties in the context of much larger uncertainties in atmospheric forcings.},

Bislang existieren kaum systematische Untersuchungen zu den hydraulischen Eigenschaften von Waldböden. Wir führten Multi-Step-Outflow-Versuche durch, um die Wasserretentionskurve und die ungesättigte hydraulische Leitfähigkeit an insgesamt 1504 ungestörten Proben von Waldböden Baden-Württembergs zu ermitteln. Unter Verwendung zusätzlicher Messungen (Fraktionen des Fein- und Grobbodens, Trockenrohdichte, Gehalt an organischem Material) wurden Pedotransferfunktionen zur Schätzung der Parameter des Mualem/van Genuchten-Modells entwickelt. Die Schätzungen der neuen Pedotransferfunktionen wurden mit verschiedenen Pedotransferfunktionen aus der Literatur verglichen. Ein Vorteil der neuen Pedotransferfunktionen ist, dass sie unverzerrte Schätzungen der hydraulischen Eigenschaften der Waldböden von Baden-Württemberg liefern; ihre Vorhersagegüte ist vergleichbar mit veröffentlichten Pedotransferfunktionen.},

	abstract = {Phosphorus (P) deficiency of beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) is widespread in Europe. However, it is difficult to determine at which sites trees are prone to P deficiency, since foliar analysis is the only tool widely accepted for assessing the P nutritional status of beech. Our central objective was to identify the main influencing factors on organic P in forest soils and to test its usefulness as a predictor of the foliar P content of beech. Our hypotheses were: (1) stocks of total organic P (TOP) and microbial biomass P (MBP) in the mineral soil are higher at mull than at moder/mor sites, (2) the TOP content and the soil organic carbon (SOC):TOP ratio are affected by soil mineralogical characteristics, such as oxalate-extractable iron and aluminum (Feox, Alox) and clay, (3) multiple regression models that include the TOP stock, soil mineralogical parameters and the humus form as predictors are useful to explain the variability of the foliar P content of beech. We sampled the mineral soils of 9 mull and 11 moder/mor sites at 0–50 cm depth and took foliar samples of beech trees in three subsequent years. In contrast to our hypothesis (1), we did not find significantly higher TOP or MBP stocks, but determined lower SOC:TOP ratios at mull compared to moder/mor sites. In line with our hypothesis (2), the TOP content was positively related to Feox, Alox and clay contents, while the SOC:TOP ratio was negatively related to Feox, Alox and clay contents, suggesting strong effects of clay, Al and Fe on the accumulation of TOP. In partial agreement with our hypothesis (3), the TOP stock was included as a positive and the clay content as a negative predictor in a multiple regression model of the foliar P content, suggesting decreasing bioavailability of TOP with increasing clay content. Across all sites, the model consisting of these two parameters better explained the foliar P content (R2 = 0.60) than the stocks of Bray-II- (R2 = 0.37) or Olsen-extractable P (R2 = 0.53) as single predictors. Overall, our results suggest that the accumulation of TOP in forest mineral soils and its potential availability to beech are strongly affected by soil mineralogical parameters, which may be included in statistical models to improve the predictability of P availability to trees.},
